    <h2>Tips and Tricks for Good Fortniting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Master Building:</strong> Building quickly and efficiently can give you a huge advantage in battles.
            Practice your building skills in Creative mode.</li>
        <li><strong>Know Your Weapons:</strong> Familiarize yourself with different weapons and their stats. Find your
            favorite loadout and practice with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Storm:</strong> Always keep an eye on the storm circle and plan your movements accordingly
            to avoid getting caught.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Headphones:</strong> Sound is crucial in Fortnite. Using headphones can help you hear enemy
            footsteps and chest locations better.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Smart:</strong> Choose your landing spots wisely. High-traffic areas can be risky, while
            secluded spots might give you a chance to loot safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Learn to Edit:</strong> Editing your structures quickly can confuse opponents and create
            opportunities to escape or attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Play with Friends:</strong> Teaming up with friends can enhance your strategy and make the game more
            enjoyable.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> In tense situations, staying calm can help you make better decisions and improve
            your chances of victory.</li>
